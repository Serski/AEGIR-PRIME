# JSX Automation

Example Photoshop ExtendScript helpers.

## Prerequisites

- Adobe Photoshop with ExtendScript support.

## Running a Script

1. Open Photoshop.
2. Choose `File > Scripts > Browse...`.
3. Select one of the `.jsx` files in this directory, such as `hello-world.jsx`.

Photoshop executes the script immediately. You can copy these files into Photoshop's `Presets/Scripts` folder to make them appear directly under the `File > Scripts` menu.
